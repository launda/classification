    "The goal of this notebook is to implement your own binary decision tree classifier. You will:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Use SFrames to do some feature engineering.\n",
    "* Transform categorical variables into binary variables.\n",
    "* Write a function to compute the number of misclassified examples in an intermediate node.\n",
    "* Write a function to find the best feature to split on.\n",
    "* Build a binary decision tree from scratch.\n",
    "* Make predictions using the decision tree.\n",
    "* Evaluate the accuracy of the decision tree.\n",
    "* Visualize the decision at the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: In this assignment, we will focus on building decision trees where the data contain **only binary (0 or 1) features**. This allows us to avoid dealing with:\n",
    "* Multiple intermediate nodes in a split\n",
    "* The thresholding issues of real-valued features.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details of the tree-building process\n",
    "* It is computationally infeasible to consider every possible partition of the predictor feature space.\n",
    "* For this reason, we take a **top-down, greedy** approach that is known as **recursive binary splitting.**\n",
    "* The approach is **top-down** because it begins at the top of the tree and then successively splits the predictor space; each split is indicated via **two new branches** further down on the tree, we store this as **left_tree** and **right_tree**.\n",
    "* It is **greedy** because at each step of the tree-building process, the **best split** is made at that particular step (split on feature that results in **lowest classification error rate**),rather than looking ahead and picking a split that will lead to a better tree in some future step."

    "82% of data samples were safe loans, and about 18% risky loans, so huge class imbalance. Given 82% of the loans are safe, if we predict that all loans are safe, we will be correct 82% of the time. That sounds like high accuracy, but is not. We need our accurcay to be better than 80% if we are to do do better than prior probability - background spread or distribution! Bit like in fog forecasting, fog only occurs 2% of days in a year, so if we forecast no fog every time, we will be correct 98% of the time. But 2% of the time we will be wrong - we have to determine if this false negatives is acceptable risk to industry."

Another approachis using sklearns LabelEncoder()."
