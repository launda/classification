Given 82% of the loans are safe, if we predict that all loans are safe, we will be correct 82% of the time. That sounds like high accuracy, but is not. We need our accurcay to be better than 80% if we are to do do better than prior probability - background spread or distribution! Bit like in fog forecasting, fog only occurs 2% of days in a year, so if we forecast no fog every time, we will be correct 98% of the time. But 2% of the time we will be wrong - we have to determine if this false negatives is acceptable risk to industry."

    "Since we are implementing **binary decision trees**, we transform our categorical data into binary data using 1-hot encoding, just as in the previous assignment. Here is the summary of that discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the **home_ownership** feature represents the home ownership status of the loanee, which is either `own`, `mortgage` or `rent`. For example, if a data point has the feature \n",
    "```\n",
    "   {'home_ownership': 'RENT'}\n",

    "```\n",
    " { \n",
    "   'home_ownership = OWN'      : 0, \n",
    "   'home_ownership = MORTGAGE' : 0, \n",
    "   'home_ownership = RENT'     : 1\n",
    " }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this code requires a few Python and GraphLab tricks, feel free to use this block of code as is. Refer to the API documentation for a deeper understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** This technique of turning categorical variables into binary variables is called one-hot encoding. Using the software of your choice, perform one-hot encoding on the four features described above. You should now have 25 binary features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this code requires a few Python tricks, feel free to use this block of code as is - note it will only work with sframes!. Refer to the API documentation for a deeper understanding. Note that for some categorical features, more features are created than existing levels, for e.g home_ownership has 3 levels, 'OWN', 'RENT', 'MORTGAGE' but one-hot encoding creates 4 levels, an extra level called 'OTHER', so in effect creates 4 seperate features when we would have expected only 3 expected features. Another approach is using sklearns LabelEncoder().\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally one-hot encoding appears to be better approach than using LabelEncoder which assigns different numerical values to seperate levels in a class. E.g home_ownership column values will be assighned numeric value 1 for 'RENT', 2 for 'OWN', 3 for 'MORTGAGE'. This often causes the decision tree classfier to treat the feature as numeric so we start to see splits like (home_ownership <= 2.5) which may not always have meaningful interpretation.\n",

A smaller tree with fewer splits (that is, resulting in fewer nodes/leaves) might lead to lower variance and better interpretation at the cost of a little bias. One possible alternative is to build the tree only so long as the decrease in the error rate/RSS due to each split exceeds some (high) threshold. This strategy will result in smaller trees, but maybe is too short-sighted since a seemingly worthless split early on in the tree might be followed by a very good splitâ€”that is, a split that leads to a large reduction in error rate/RSS later on. see page 307 ISLR. Anyway we will implement function `error_reduction()` that will help us check if error reduction resulting from split under consideration will exceed some threshold. Ir reduction in error rate due to new split is lower than the set threshold, then we won't make the split and set itermediate node as a leaf instead."

Only a fraction lower!!! We expect it to be lower, cause old tree was overfitting, so whiole its train error wud always be lower, its valid/test error should be higher as it won't be able to generalise well. New tree avoids overfitting when learning the tree, so should be able to generalise better and probbaly achieve lower validation/test errors on unseen data."
