These approaches are beyond the scope of this course, but some of them are reviewed in in \"[Learning from Imbalanced Data](http://www.ele.uri.edu/faculty/he/PDFfiles/ImbalancedLearning.pdf)\" by Haibo He and Edwardo A. Garcia, *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering* **21**(9) (June 26, 2009), p. 1263–1284. For this assignment, we use the simplest possible approach, where we subsample the overly represented class to get a more balanced dataset. In general, and especially when the data is highly imbalanced, we recommend using more advanced methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Attempting to learn from imbalanced data is difficult; namely, that assessing the performance of a classifier trained on an imbalanced dataset is more difficult. A real-world email dataset is likely to be imbalanced because approximately 90% of all email sent is spam. The so-called majority class classifier which labels all email as spam would therefore have ~90% accuracy on a representative test dataset. Overall accuracy or error of a spam email classifier does not provide adequate information for evaluation purposes because of this imbalance. We would need to look at other assessment metrics such as precision-recall curves for more conclusive evaluation of a classifier's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bit like in fog forecasting, fog only occurs 2% of days in a year, so if we forecast no fog every time, we will be correct 98% of the time. Although this is very high accuracy, it does not provide adequate information for evaluation purposes. 2% of the time we will be wrong - we have to determine if this false negatives is acceptable risk to industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another, more important reason why attempting to learn from an imbalanced dataset is difficult is that many algorithms assume balanced class distributions or relatively equal costs of misclassification. If that is not the case, then important distinguishing characteristics may go unlearned."
