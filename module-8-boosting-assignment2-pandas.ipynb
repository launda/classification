    "Here we have 2 labels -1 and 3 labels +1. Majority is +1, so num mistakes wud be 2 (num of -1 labels). Note here we not counting num of data points we make mistakes with but the weight of those data points, so things are a bit different. The sum of weights of the 2 labels (-1) is not 2 but 1+2 = 3). The combined weight of the 3 +ve +1 labels is 0.5+1+1 = 2.5. Now we have to check for which label prediction the weight of mistakes/misclassified class is lowest. If we predict all data points to be -1 class, then the wt of mistakes would be 2.5 (wt of the +1 class). If we predict all data points as +1 class, then weight of mistakes is weight of the miclassified class i.e the +1 class i.e 3. 2.5 is < 3, so if we predict all data points as -1 class, we get lowest weight of misclassified class. So we return 2.5 as the min of the 2 misclassified classes(min[2.5,3]) and the class prediction that achieves lowest mistakes would be when we predict all points in intermediate node to be -1 class."
